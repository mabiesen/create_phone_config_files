Call tested, speed dial tested




1.  has the host name of ha9888-ip-newtest  (at least mine did)
-nmap pulled it up as such:  ha9888-ip-newtest.percipia.local
-looks like hostname easily set in gui

2.  Before it will register, a useragent must be set under sip account -> sip settings

3.  Speed dial and memory dial keys not automatically set

4.  Time settings found under administration -> management, ntp hosts already set

5.  Auto provisioning allowed, found under admin -> provisioning
- option 66 enabled by default
- uses mac address for file name.  No filename extension by default.  lowercase letters.  Mac address variable is set as $(MA)

6.  Telnet capable, port 23.  disabled by default

7.  ICMP ping offered as an option.  what does it do? why is it called ICMP ping, isnt that by definition?

8.  Has a web dial option!!!!! 

9.  Call immediately key is # by default

10. Call log works, but doesn't appear to log web-based calls?

11.  MEMORY KEYS APPEAR TO REQUIRE MASTER CLONER??  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
- Manual suggested cloner - https://www.manualslib.com/manual/757042/Bittel-Ha9888-69-Tsd-S.html?page=2#manual
- But in reality, memory keys are speed dials.  This was not immediately evident, there are 10 listed in gui but 5 on phone

12.  Changes to any configuration requires reboot it seems.  You are alerted to this.

13.  On reboot, phone will flash and then about 5 seconds later the gui returns.

14.  phone is automatically configured to search for firmware upgrades


On the config file
1.  multi function keys have a weird syntax in config file.  To see what populated looks like.
- 1$0$0$124$124$  -  This is an example.  In order values as follow:  type, mode, line, expansion, label

2.  extension is "DBID_SIP_PHONE_NUM="
3.  config file encrypts password in hex + hash
